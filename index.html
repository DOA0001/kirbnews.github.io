<div class="homeparagraph"><h2>Featured Article!</h2><br>Super Smash Ultimate has been one of the hottest game topics since its first preview at Nintendo Direct. Now that it is coming into the month before release, fans of the franchise are going insane over how good this game is and whether it will live up to expectations. With an all new campaign where you play as Kirby after the whole Nintendo universe has mysteriously been turned evil, chances are looking pretty good for this new release set out to amaze its audience. However, the game itself has disappointed some with the odd character choices coming from Nintendo. To people’s dismay, Waluigi isn’t being announced for Smash even following Nintendo’s statement that ‘everyone is here’. Smash fans all around the world started an outrage causing many stories, memes and more to arise from Waluigi not being in Smash. It truly was a dark time for the lovers of all things Waluigi and his stylish purple overalls. He didn’t deserve this injustice, however Nintendo decided it was for the best that he wasn’t in the game. When the Waluigi crisis wasn’t bad enough, it was also announced that Shadow isn’t going to be on the Smash character roster this year. This was a real surprise to the fans as Shadow was one of the most highly anticipated characters signed up onto the Smash roster as an echo fighter for Sonic. This caused a major uproar since people were getting hyped about Shadow being in the game prior to the announcement that he wasn’t in it. Finally, an odd surprise to many, many Smash fans was the announcement of Piranha Plant in Smash. To unlock him, you have to pre-order the game to get the plant as DLC to the game. For a character no one was really asking for, personally, playing as a piranha plant seems kind of fun and a fresh change to the classic characters. It’s a fresh turn in the normal characters and can give tons of enjoyment.</div>
